# scripts/set-host-password.sh
#
# Create/set the user (t3u) and root password hashes in
# secrets/hosts/<hostname>.yaml via sops, from interactively entered
# passwords. Passwords are read with read -s (not echoed, not in argv/history)
# and converted to a sha-512 crypt hash with mkpasswd.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/set-host-password.sh <hostname>
#
#   <hostname> is the hosts/<name>/ dir (SOPS key prefix is derived from it).
#   mkpasswd must be on PATH (nix shell nixpkgs#mkpasswd -c bash "$0" ... ).
#
# Requires the repo's .sops.yaml creation rules to cover secrets/hosts/<host>.
# The user/root password hash keys are `<hostkey>_t3u_password_hash` and
# `<hostkey>_root_password_hash` where <hostkey> is the lowercased hostname
# with '-' -> '_'.
